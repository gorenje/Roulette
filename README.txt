Roulette Sage

Roulette Sage predicts what will come up with the next spin of the wheel. Enter numbers as they come up and Roulette Sage will make a prediction of the next number.

The inner wheel indicates where the possible next spin will fall. Green indicates where the most likely position will be and the transparency provides an indication of the prediction confidence. The darker the inner wheel, the higher the prediction confidence however no guarantee is made that the prediction will be accurate.

First prediction is made after at least five spins have been entered. After that, predictions are updated with every spin entered.

Please note that the current version only supports a French layout, i.e. there is no double zero. Also numbers are not stored between starts of the application, they will always have to be reentered.
